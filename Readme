----------------------------

The shell can now also use basic line editor commands.

1. The arrow keys can be used to move the cursor around and allow for 
   inserting text at any position that isn't out of bounds

2. The up and down keys go through the history of commands that were used. 
   If the user is on the last command and presses down it will just go to a blank line

3. The ctrl a key goes to the start of the line and the ctrl e key will go to the end

4. The ctrl d (delete) key will delete the character at the cursor position

5. The ctrl h (backspace) key delete the character to the left of the cursor

6. Basic path substitution has also been implemented. 
   If there is a char before the cursor (or group of chars) 
   it will either put the only result that matches in the line
   or the common preceding substring of all the results. It however
   doesn't check if the word is an argument or a command like regular
   bash does. AKA typing vi and then tab won't result in vim
